# DISCORD_SERVER.md

## Overview

This document defines the official structure, guidelines, backlog, and growth strategy for the the **Trophi.gg Discord Server**.  
It is designed as a **hybrid document**: part documentation, part executable backlog to be used by whoever sets up and maintains the server.

---

## 1. Purpose of the Server (Pre-Launch → Post-Launch)

The Trophi.gg Discord server exists to:

- Build an early community around achievement hunters, trophy hunters, and completionists.  
- Serve as the main hub for announcements, roadmap updates, and changelogs.  
- Collect feedback on features, UX, bugs, and future ideas.  
- Provide a place where players can share achievements and celebrate mastery together.  
- Enable AI-powered achievement help and discussion (initially manual, later via bot).  
- Support events, challenges, and future programs (Trials, Legendary runs, etc.).  
- Connect players, creators, and the Trophi team in one central place.

This server should feel like **the home base for people who want to master their games.**

---

## 2. Core Principles

1. **Clarity first** – Channels should be intuitive, minimal, and clearly labeled.  
2. **Scalability** – The structure must support future expansions (more channels, events, roles) without needing a full redesign.  
3. **Identity-driven** – Roles, emojis, and copy should reinforce the Trophi “mastery, completion, progress” identity.  
4. **Safe, respectful space** – Strong moderation to keep the environment welcoming, inclusive, and fun.  
5. **Growth-ready** – The server should be ready to onboard users coming from the landing page, email, and future in-app links.  
6. **Low friction** – Easy to navigate, easy to participate, easy to understand where to post.  

---

## 3. Information Architecture (Server Structure)

This is the **initial structure**, focused on Pre-Launch and MVP.  
Additional categories/channels can be added in V1/V2.

### 3.1 Categories & Channels

#### 🧭 Category: `WELCOME`

- `#welcome` – First touchpoint, brief intro and quick-start.
- `#rules` – Server rules and code of conduct.
- `#roles` – Reaction roles to personalize experience.

#### 📢 Category: `ANNOUNCEMENTS`

- `#changelog` – Product updates, new features, bug fixes.
- `#roadmap` – Roadmap snapshots, phase changes (MVP → V1 → V2).
- `#news` – General announcements, early access waves, events, trials.

#### 🎮 Category: `COMMUNITY`

- `#general-chat` – Main community discussion.
- `#show-your-achievements` – Screenshots, trophy pops, completion screens.
- `#game-discussions` – Talk about specific games, series, genres.
- `#setup-gallery` – Share gaming setups, rigs, and desk flex.
- `#off-topic` – Anything outside games & Trophi.

#### 🤖 Category: `AI HELP` (Soft mode initially)

These channels will exist **from Pre-Launch**, but AI automation will evolve over time.

- `#achievement-help` – Ask questions about achievements and how to obtain them.  
- `#walkthroughs` – Discuss routes, runs, and spoiler-safe guidance.  
- `#build-consulting` – Help with builds for RPGs or complex games.

> **Pre-Launch / MVP:** these channels can be answered manually (by you + mods + external tools).  
> **Later:** they will be powered by the Trophi Discord Bot.

#### 🧰 Category: `SUPPORT`

- `#bug-report` – Issues in Trophi (product or site).
- `#feature-requests` – Ideas for new features or improvements.
- `#feedback` – General feedback, impressions, suggestions.

#### 🔒 (Optional, internal) Category: `STAFF`

- `#staff-chat` – Internal communication between admins / mods.
- `#mod-log` – Manual logs, decisions, notes.
- `#auto-log` – Logs from bots (joins, bans, automod events).

## 4. Copy & Templates (English)

These are base texts your friend can paste and pin.  
You can refine tone later, but they are already aligned with Trophi’s brand.

### 4.1 `#welcome`

> 👋 **Welcome to Trophi.gg – Official Server!**  
>
> This is the home for completionists, trophy hunters, and anyone who loves mastering their games.  
>
> • Start by reading **#rules**  
> • Then pick your roles in **#roles**  
> • Say hi in **#general-chat** and show us what you’re playing!  
>
> Track. Master. Achieve. 🏆

### 4.2 `#rules`

> ## 📜 Server Rules  
>
> 1. **Be respectful.** No harassment, hate speech, or toxicity.  
> 2. **No NSFW content.** Keep the server safe for everyone.  
> 3. **No spam or flooding.** Don’t abuse mentions, links, or bots.  
> 4. **No self-promotion without permission.** That includes servers, channels, or external links for monetization.  
> 5. **Keep game discussions healthy.** Disagreeing is fine, personal attacks are not.  
> 6. **Follow Discord’s Terms of Service.**  
>  
> ⚠️ Breaking these rules may result in warnings, timeouts, or permanent bans.

### 4.3 `#roles`

> 🎮 **Choose your roles**  
>
> React below to select the roles that best match your playstyle.  
> This helps us tailor announcements, pings, and events to what you care about.  
>
> • 🎯 **Completionist** – You love 100% runs and full trophy lists.  
> • 🏆 **Trophy Hunter** – You chase achievements across multiple games.

> • 🎮 **Casual Gamer** – You play for fun, progress, and good stories.  
>
> More role types may be added as the community grows.

### 4.4 `#feature-requests`

> 💡 **Got an idea for Trophi?**  
>
> Tell us what you’d like to see next. When sending a feature request, try to include:  
> • The problem it solves  
> • How it would help you or other players  
> • Any examples from other tools you like  
>
> We read everything and use this channel to shape our roadmap.

### 4.5 `#bug-report`

> 🐛 **Found a bug in Trophi?**  
>
> Please include, if possible:  
> • What happened  
> • What you expected to happen  
> • Screenshots or videos  
> • Browser / device info  
>
> This helps us reproduce and fix issues faster.

## 5. Backlog – Phased Execution

This backlog is structured by **product phase**.  
Your friend can follow it **top to bottom** and check items as they go.

### 5.1 PRE-LAUNCH (Now)

Focus: create a clean, usable, low-friction community space to support the landing page and early access.

#### 5.1.1 Server Setup

- [ ] Create the Discord server with the name: **Trophi.gg – Official**  
- [ ] Upload the Trophi logo as the server icon  
- [ ] Add a banner (static or animated) based on the LP visual identity  
- [ ] Configure server region, basic settings, and default notifications (only mentions recommended)

#### 5.1.2 Categories & Channels

- [ ] Create category **WELCOME** with `#welcome`, `#rules`, `#roles`  
- [ ] Create category **ANNOUNCEMENTS** with `#changelog`, `#roadmap`, `#news`  
- [ ] Create category **COMMUNITY** with `#general-chat`, `#show-your-achievements`, `#game-discussions`, `#setup-gallery`, `#off-topic`  
- [ ] Create category **AI HELP** with `#achievement-help`, `#walkthroughs`, `#build-consulting`  
- [ ] Create category **SUPPORT** with `#bug-report`, `#feature-requests`, `#feedback`  
- [ ] (Optional) Create category **STAFF** with `#staff-chat`, `#mod-log`, `#auto-log`  

#### 5.1.3 Roles & Permissions

- [ ] Create core roles: **Owner**, **Admin**, **Moderator**, **Community Manager**, **Bot Manager**, **Developers**  
- [ ] Create player roles: **Completionist**, **Trophy Hunter**, **RPG Lover**, **Souls-like Player**, **Casual Gamer**  
- [ ] Restrict write access in `ANNOUNCEMENTS` to staff only  
- [ ] Ensure `SUPPORT` channels are visible to everyone, but logs/config channels are private  
- [ ] Configure view/send rules to avoid confusion (no “dead” channels for normal users)

#### 5.1.4 Bots (Essential)

- [ ] Add **MEE6** or **Dyno** for basic moderation and automod  
- [ ] Add **Carl-bot** for reaction roles  
- [ ] Add **Statbot** (or similar) for basic metrics (member count, activity)  
- [ ] Configure logs to go into `#auto-log`  

#### 5.1.5 Text & Onboarding

- [ ] Paste and pin the **welcome** message in `#welcome`  
- [ ] Paste and pin the **rules** in `#rules`  
- [ ] Configure Discord’s built-in **Welcome Screen** with:  
  - Short description of the server  
  - Recommended channels: `#welcome`, `#general-chat`, `#show-your-achievements`  
- [ ] Set up a simple automated welcome message (MEE6/Dyno) tagging new users and pointing them to `#welcome`

#### 5.1.6 Growth Hooks (Pre-Launch)

- [ ] Prepare a “first achievements” prompt in `#show-your-achievements` (e.g., “Post your latest or proudest achievement screenshot here!”)  
- [ ] Prepare 1–2 simple polls in `#news` (e.g., “What platforms do you play on?” / “What type of player are you?”)  
- [ ] Add Discord invite link to the Trophi landing page (after waitlist confirmation or email welcome).

---

### 5.2 MVP (Early Access Beta)

Focus: start testing community dynamics, gather structured feedback, and manually simulate bot-like help.

#### 5.2.1 Community Programs

- [ ] Launch **Weekly Discussion** topics in `#game-discussions`  
- [ ] Start a **“Show us your 100% runs”** recurring thread in `#show-your-achievements`  
- [ ] Create a **“Member of the Week”** pattern (mention in `#news` or `#general-chat`)  
- [ ] Encourage use of `#setup-gallery` with a few initial posts (you + friends)

#### 5.2.2 AI Help (Manual Phase)

- [ ] Define simple guidelines for answering in `AI HELP` channels (tone, spoiler safety, etc.)  
- [ ] Use your own AI tools (outside Discord for now) to answer tricky questions, then paste curated responses  
- [ ] Start a small “knowledge base” (even if informal) of good answers that later can become training material for the Trophi Bot

#### 5.2.3 Onboarding and Product Flow

- [ ] Add links in `#welcome` and `#news` pointing to:  
  - Trophi landing page  
  - Early access form or waitlist  
- [ ] Optionally tag roles when announcing early tests (e.g., ping Completionists first)  
- [ ] Track how many users join Discord from LP vs from direct invites (via Statbot or custom UTMs later)

---

### 5.3 V1 (Post-MVP, Growing Community)

Focus: deepen engagement, create themed events, and introduce creators.

#### 5.3.1 Community Expansion

- [ ] Add game or genre-specific channels only when volume demands it (e.g., `#soulslike-hub`, `#jrpg-hub`)  
- [ ] Introduce **Trophi Levels**: internal concept of milestones for the community (XP not required, just themed roles or badges)
- [ ] Create a **Creator** role and a **creator-lounge** channel for guide writers and streamers

#### 5.3.2 Events

- [ ] Monthly **100% completion** challenges (pick 1–2 games and encourage players to go for 100%)  
- [ ] Themed weeks (e.g., **Soulsborne Challenge Week**, **Metroidvania Month**)  
- [ ] Build competitions in `#build-consulting` (best build shares get a mention or role)

#### 5.3.3 Integrations

- [ ] Add the **Trophi Discord Bot** (see `TECH_DISCORD_BOT.md`) once basic API and flows are ready  
- [ ] Start with a small set of slash commands (`/achievement`, `/missable`, `/build`, `/route`)  
- [ ] Forward bot usage logs to `#bot-logs`

---

### 5.4 V2 (Mature Community + Platform Integration)

Focus: deep integration with the product, creators, and monetization.

#### 5.4.1 Advanced AI Integration

- [ ] Allow users to query AI from Discord with context from their Trophi profiles  
- [ ] Introduce personal “Mastery summaries” or highlights inside Discord  
- [ ] Consider DMs from bot for opt-in features (never spam, always consent-based)

#### 5.4.2 Creator & Marketplace Integration

- [ ] Dedicated channels or flows for creators to share and promote guides  
- [ ] Integrations between Trophi marketplace and Discord (e.g., posting when a new guide goes live)  
- [ ] Role-based perks for creators (e.g., colored names, exclusive channels)

---

## 6. Future-Proofing & Best Practices

To make it easy to expand later, follow these guidelines from the start:

- Use clear, lowercase channel names with hyphens (e.g., `#game-discussions`, not `#GameDiscussions`).  
- Use channel topics/descriptions to explain what belongs in each place.  
- Avoid creating too many channels before there is demand. Start lean.  
- Use slowmode in `#general-chat` if traffic becomes hard to moderate.  
- Keep `AI HELP` channels open but manage expectations until the bot is live (pin a message clarifying current status).  
- Keep internal/staff channels clearly separated and hidden from normal members.  
- Use roles thoughtfully: don’t create a new role for every small detail.  

---

## 7. Final Deliverables

When your friend finishes this backlog, the server should:

- Be fully structured with all core categories and channels.  
- Have clear rules, roles, and onboarding.  
- Have essential bots installed and configured.  
- Be safe, easy to navigate, and in line with the Trophi brand.  
- Be ready for early community members and prepared for future growth.

This document can evolve over time, but it should always serve as the **single source of truth** for how the Trophi.gg Discord server is organized and why.
